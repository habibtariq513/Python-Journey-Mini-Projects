# == Important Notes ==
# 1. Ensure that the PyPDF2 library is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
'pip install PyPDF2'
# 2. This script merges PDF files in the order they are provided by the user.
# 3. The merged PDF will be saved in the current working directory with the name 'Merged_PDF.pdf'.
# 4. If a specified PDF file does not exist in the current directory, the script will notify the user and exit.
# 5. Must Add those PDF that you wanna MERGE in the same Directory where you'll write code.
# 6. These Added PDFs are just for the sake of Example :).
